<p>Rules of Balckjack:</p>
<p>The goal of blackjack is to beat the value of a dealer's cards without exceeding a point-value of 21 per hand. Both player and dealer are dealt two cards, with only the player's hand face-up. Points are determined in a hand by adding the numeric values of cards (either the number of the card, or 10 for face-cards/royalty, or either 1 or 11 for Aces depending on preference in each hand). After the first two cards are revealed, the player can either keep only the two cards presented or be "hit" by another card by request. Once the player decides to stay (without "busting" by exceeding 21 points for the hand), the dealer reveals their cards and hits if the value is less than 17. Whomever has the highest point value after the process is completed wins the hand.
