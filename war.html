<p>Rules of War:</p>
<p>War is a simple comparison game between two players. Hands are won by presenting a higher card (drawn from the top of a dealt deck) than your opponent. Only two players will be allowed in this version. Card value is the same as face value, with Ace as the highest-value card. The entire deck is dealt out to the two players, and a player wins once their opponents share of the deck has been entirely depleted.
